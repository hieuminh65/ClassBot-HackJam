And in this chapter, we're going to cover things like why computer networks are important, why data is sent on computer networks as packets of information, the important tasks that must be performed to deliver each packet of information to its destination without error, and the standard technologies that accomplish these tasks, such as the TCP/IP stack. Now, business data communications can be defined as the movement of information from one computer application on one computer to another computer by means of an electrical or optical transmission system. Transmission systems are called networks. So in this course, we would use this synonymously with defining computer networking. Here's an illustration of a typical home network that is trying to communicate with a host or resource on a university network. So if you were sitting at home with your laptop or PC, opened up a browser, and were trying to get to a web page on the USF web server, first, you would type in the URL of the web server resource you were trying to get to. The request would then go through the home router, which would then go through the internet service provider network, and route the request to the University of South Florida's network. Once inside the campus network, then it would be routed to locate the web server host resource that you were trying to get to through the browser. Once the resource responds, the acknowledgment will go back through the network, to your home network through the home router, back to the and, the application will respond with the content requested from the web server. There are a common set of technologies that support all network computer applications on a PC. So for instance, on your own laptop, you probably have things like an email client, like Microsoft Outlook or web-based email clients. You use instant messaging clients. You browse the internet with browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox or Chrome. If you're in a business, there's often client server applications, where you have a client application on your laptop or PC that communicates with an enterprise system. So these basic principles of being able to use technology in a network environment have basically remained unchanged for many decades and they will continue to persist within the future to support the modern economy. If you look back in history, as far back as the 1800s, you'll find inventions which have eventually evolved in today's modern packet-switching networks.
